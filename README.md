/// This project is a basic cooking recipe website built with basic HTML skills.
/// The goal is to utilize my early HTML skills to create a functional website and to apply the skills I have  learned to further develop my skill set. 
/// The website at first will not be styled but will be revisted at a later date once CSS skills are learned.


/// At the end of this project I will have demonstrated my ability to use HTML and its various elements and commands to create a fluid and functional website that utilizes different pages, links, pictures, paragraphs, and text styles. I will also demonstrate proper data organization on the back end to ensure that navigation is smooth and seamless.
